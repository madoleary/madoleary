üé¨ **[Drameter](https://github.com/madoleary/drameter)** ‚Äî Smart screenplay timing tool for filmmakers. *Not marketers.*

> A practical bridge between creativity and production logistics, drawing on both my tech skills and filmmaking experience.

**Why it‚Äôs different:**  
- üóÇÔ∏è Scene-by-scene analysis from screenplay headings (INT./EXT.)  
- üó£Ô∏è Differentiates dialogue from action for accurate pacing  
- üé≠ Beat-aware timing: adds pauses for `(beat)` cues
- üéûÔ∏è Detects montage sequences and transition cues  
- üìù Tags scenes with notes like `montage + dialogue`, missing time of day, and detected transitions  
- üì§ CSV export for production use  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Built with **Python** + [`pdfplumber`](https://pypi.org/project/pdfplumber/)  
- ü™™ MIT licensed, open to contributions

**Who it helps:**  
- Writers refining act structure  
- Directors planning shoots  
- Assistant Directors coordinating production  
- Editors spotting pacing gaps  
- Producers estimating runtime beyond page count
