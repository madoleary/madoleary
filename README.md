🎬 **[Drameter](https://github.com/madoleary/drameter)**: Define the metadata of film language.

> Drameter analyzes the underlying structure, rhythm, and cinematic language of a screenplay, quantifying tone, pacing, and visual storytelling at the scene level.

**Why it’s different:**  
- 🗂️ Scene-by-scene analysis from screenplay headings (INT./EXT.)  
- 🗣️ Differentiates dialogue from action for accurate pacing  
- 🎭 Beat-aware timing: includes pauses for `(beat)` cues  
- 🎞️ Visual pacing detection: montage, flashback, intercuts, fast cuts, and more  
- 📝 Flags no-dialogue and low-dialogue scenes, transitions, and structural cues  
- 📤 CSV export for production, editing, and planning  
- ⚙️ Built with **Python** + [`pdfplumber`](https://pypi.org/project/pdfplumber/)  
- 🪪 MIT licensed, open to contributions

**Who it helps:**  
- Writers refining structure and rhythm  
- Directors shaping tone and timing  
- Assistant Directors tackling production complexities 
- Editors anticipating pacing and style  
- Producers estimating real runtime beyond page count
